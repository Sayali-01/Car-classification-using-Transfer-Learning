# Car-classification-using-Transfer-Learning
This model aims to develop a car classification model for Intelligent Transportation System using the concept of Transfer Learning. The project consists of different CNN algorithms ( VGG16 , Resnet50 and Inception_V3) .
1. Download seperate training and testing Stanford Car Dataset from https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html.
2. Upload the dataset to your google drive.
3. Mount your Drive to colab.
4. Initially , Run the three models using Colab GPU ( VGG16 , Resnet50 and inception V3).
5. Finally , Now run the Comparison model to check for the comparison between the three models.
6. Happy Journey!!!!!
